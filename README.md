# A-RE Windows
Windows applications analysis utility <br> (pretty simple at the moment, but who knows whats coming up next..) <br>

## Current features:
- Retrieving basic sample information, such as `compiler info`, `packer info`, `installer info`
- Detecting sample capabilities based on large collection of yara rules
- Custom yara checker for testing your own yara rules
- Cross-platform user-friendly UI powered by Tkinter!

## Credits:
- [RetDec](https://github.com/avast/retdec) for providing yara rules
- [Yara-Rules](https://github.com/Yara-Rules/rules) for providing yara rules
- [PETools](https://github.com/petoolse/petools) for signatures that i generated some yara rules from
- [Detect It Easy](https://github.com/horsicq/Detect-It-Easy) for signatures that i generated some yara rules as well
- [rdbende](https://gitlab.com/rdbende/chlorophyll) for tkinter `chlorophyll` add-on

## Notes:
This project was made by me, and my python knowledge kinda sucks <br>
Don't expect to see quality code here (PR's are welcomed!) <br>
I'm working on this project at spare time, which means that no regular support of this tool will be provided
